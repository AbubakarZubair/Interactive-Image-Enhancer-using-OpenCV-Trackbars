# 🎨 Interactive Image Enhancer using OpenCV Trackbars

An interactive real-time image enhancement tool built with Python and OpenCV.  
This application allows users to dynamically adjust an image’s **brightness**, **contrast**, **saturation**, and **gamma correction** using intuitive trackbars — with instant visual feedback.

# 📖 Description
This tool demonstrates how basic image processing operations can be interactively applied using OpenCV's trackbars. It processes a static image and allows real-time adjustments of visual properties like brightness, contrast, saturation, and gamma correction, updating the image instantly in a resizable display window.

It’s a great learning tool for those studying image processing concepts or building quick image enhancement utilities.
